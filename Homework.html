        Autocompleting text with known values seems like an easy problem to
        solve, but so so so many Uls get it wrong. I see this frequently enough
        that, rather than complain about them individually, I though I'd just
        write down the set of rules they often break.
      </p>
      <p>
        There may be cases where some of these rules aren't the best thing to
        do, but there should be a good reason for breaking one of these rules
        (for example, some of these rules don't apply if a field must be filled
        with a value from a fixed set, like the list of US states). Following
        these rules should always result in at very least a sane experience:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="list">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Exact matches always come first. If the user types in an option
          exactly, other options must always go below the one matching what they
          typed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Besides exact matches, prefix matches come first. If I type “Fr” I
          want “Fresno” not “San Francisco.”
        </li>
        <li>
          After prefix matches, it can fall back to substring matches. Starting
          with substring matches would almost always be the wrong thing to do
          since users start typing words at the beginning not somewhere in the
          middle.
        </li>
        <li>
          If there are no substring matches, it can optionally fall back to
          subsequence matching. This is only useful in some cases.
        </li>
        <li>
          If there are no subsequence/substring matches, it can optionally fall
          back to approximate matches. This is rarely necessary to provide.
        </li>
        <li>Matches should be sorted alphabetically.</li>
        <li>
          When one option is the prefix of another,
          <em>put the shortest one first.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          The matching should probably be case insensitive unless there are two
          options that differ only by case. In that case (pun intended), prefer
          the one that more closely matches the user's input.
        </li>
        <li>
          The action to make use of the selection (e.g. to search the term) must
          be a different key than the action to accept the first suggestion
          <em>unless</em> have to do something first to start using autocomplete
          suggestions (e.g. hit the down arrow). The user should never have to
          take extra steps to <em>not</em> use autocomplete.
        </li>
      </ul>
